# Water Distribution and Hardness

## 1. Graphical Presentation of Water Distribution on Earth

The total water available on Earth is approximately 1.332 billion cubic kilometers. The distribution is as follows:

- **Saltwater (Ocean water):** 97.5%
- **Freshwater:** 2.5% 
  - **Glaciers and Ice Caps:** 68.7% 
  - **Groundwater:** 30.1%
  - **Surface Water (Rivers, lakes, etc.):** 0.3%

This distribution can be represented as a **pie chart** or **bar diagram** to visually show the proportion of saltwater and freshwater on Earth.

## 2. Classification of Soft and Hard Water Based on Soap Test

### Soft Water:
- Soft water lathers easily with soap and doesn’t form scum.
- It contains low concentrations of calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions.
- **Example:** Rainwater, distilled water.

### Hard Water:
- Hard water does not lather easily with soap and forms scum due to the presence of calcium and magnesium ions.
- **Two types of hardness:**
  - **Temporary hardness** (due to dissolved bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium).
  - **Permanent hardness** (due to dissolved salts like chlorides and sulfates of calcium and magnesium).

### Soap Test for Hardness:
- **Hard Water:** When soap is added to hard water, a white precipitate (scum) forms instead of lather.
- **Soft Water:** Soap dissolves in soft water and forms lather easily without scum.

## 3. Salts Causing Water Hardness

The primary salts that cause hardness in water are:
- **Calcium Bicarbonate (Ca(HCO₃)₂)** – Causes temporary hardness.
- **Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂), Calcium Sulfate (CaSO₄)** – Causes permanent hardness.
- **Magnesium Bicarbonate (Mg(HCO₃)₂)** – Causes temporary hardness.
- **Magnesium Chloride (MgCl₂), Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO₄)** – Causes permanent hardness.

## 4. Unit of Hardness

- **Hardness is commonly measured in ppm (parts per million)** or **mg/L**.
- The unit of hardness can also be expressed in **degrees** (°dH for German hardness, or °f for French hardness).
- **1 ppm** is equivalent to **1 mg/L** of CaCO₃ (calcium carbonate) in water.

### Simple Numerical on Water Hardness:

If the concentration of calcium ions in water is 20 mg/L, the hardness in terms of CaCO₃ would be:
- **Hardness (in ppm) = (Concentration of Ca²⁺ ions × 100) / 40**
  - (40 is the molar mass of CaCO₃, and 20 is the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions)
  - **Hardness = (20 × 100) / 40 = 50 ppm**

## 5. Causes of Poor Lathering of Soap in Hard Water

In hard water, soap reacts with calcium and magnesium ions to form insoluble salts (scum), which reduces its ability to lather. This means more soap is required to achieve the same cleaning effect, making it less efficient.

## 6. Problems Caused by the Use of Hard Water in Boilers

- **Scale and Sludge Formation:** Hard water causes the deposition of calcium and magnesium salts on the inner surfaces of boilers, leading to the formation of scale and sludge. This reduces the efficiency of heat transfer and increases energy consumption.
  
- **Foaming and Priming:** The salts in hard water can cause foaming in boilers, which can lead to the carryover of water droplets with steam (priming), causing damage to turbines and other equipment.
  
- **Corrosion:** The presence of hardness salts accelerates corrosion in pipes and boilers, leading to increased maintenance costs and potential failure of equipment.

## 7. Quantitative Measurement of Water Hardness

### EDTA Method (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid):
- **EDTA titration** is a standard method used to measure the hardness of water.
- **Procedure:**
  - A known volume of water is titrated with a standard EDTA solution, which binds to calcium and magnesium ions, allowing for the determination of hardness in terms of CaCO₃.
  
### Total Dissolved Solids (TDS):
- **TDS** represents the total concentration of dissolved substances in water, including salts, minerals, and organic matter.
- **TDS is measured in mg/L** or ppm.

### Alkalinity Estimation:
- **Alkalinity** refers to the capacity of water to neutralize acids and is primarily due to the presence of bicarbonates, carbonates, and hydroxides.
- It is measured through titration with a standard acid solution.

# Water Softening Techniques

## 1. Soda Lime Process:
The **Soda Lime Process** is used to remove temporary hardness. This involves adding **lime (Ca(OH)₂)** and **soda (Na₂CO₃)** to precipitate the calcium and magnesium ions as their carbonates, which are insoluble and can be removed.

- **Reaction:**
  - Ca(HCO₃)₂ + Ca(OH)₂ → CaCO₃ (precipitate) + H₂O
  - Mg(HCO₃)₂ + Na₂CO₃ → MgCO₃ (precipitate) + NaHCO₃

---

## 2. Zeolite Process:
- **Zeolite softening** uses a natural or synthetic zeolite (a hydrated aluminosilicate mineral) to exchange calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions.
- The zeolite acts as a cation exchange resin, thus softening the water.

- **Reaction:**
  - Na₂Zeolite + Ca²⁺ → CaZeolite + 2Na⁺
  - Na₂Zeolite + Mg²⁺ → MgZeolite + 2Na⁺

---

## 3. Ion Exchange Process:
In this method, water is passed through an ion exchange resin that exchanges calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions, effectively softening the water.

# Municipal Water Treatment

### 1. Sedimentation:
- Water is allowed to stand in large tanks so that heavier particles (like sand and silt) settle to the bottom due to gravity.

### 2. Coagulation:
- **Coagulants** like aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃) are added to the water to destabilize and clump together the fine particles, making them easier to remove.

- **Reaction:**
  - Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 6H₂O → 2Al(OH)₃ (precipitate) + 3H₂SO₄

### 3. Filtration:
- The water is passed through various layers of filters (like sand and charcoal) to remove remaining suspended particles.

### 4. Sterilization:
- The final step is to disinfect the water, usually by adding **chlorine** or through **ultraviolet (UV) light** to kill harmful microorganisms and ensure safe drinking water.

- **Chlorine Reaction:**
  - Cl₂ + H₂O → HOCl + HCl (Hypochlorous acid is the disinfectant)

# Water for Human Consumption

Water for drinking and cooking must meet specific standards to ensure it is safe. The **Indian Standard Specifications for Drinking Water (IS 10500:2012)** include guidelines on:

- **Physical Characteristics:** Odor, color, and temperature.
- **Chemical Characteristics:** pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, and presence of contaminants like fluoride, chlorine, lead, arsenic, etc.
- **Microbiological Characteristics:** Presence of pathogenic microorganisms like E. coli, coliforms, etc.

**Key Standards (as per IS 10500:2012):**
- **pH:** 6.5 to 8.5
- **TDS:** Maximum 500 mg/L
- **Hardness:** Maximum 300 mg/L as CaCO₃
- **Fluoride:** Maximum 1.0 mg/L
- **Chloride:** Maximum 250 mg/L
- **Lead:** Maximum 0.01 mg/L
- **Coliforms:** Should be absent in 100 mL of water.
