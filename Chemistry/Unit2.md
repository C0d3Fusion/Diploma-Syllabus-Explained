## 1. Water Distribution on Earth

Water on Earth is distributed in different forms, with the majority being saltwater in oceans. Freshwater, which is essential for human consumption, makes up only a small fraction. Below is a breakdown of water distribution:

- **Oceans**: 97.5% of Earth's total water
- **Freshwater**: 2.5% of Earth's total water, further categorized as:
  - **Icecaps and Glaciers**: 68.7% of freshwater
  - **Groundwater**: 30.1% of freshwater
  - **Surface Water**: 0.3% of freshwater

### Pie Chart Representation
This section will include a pie chart representing the distribution of water on Earth, showing the relative proportions of oceans, icecaps, groundwater, and surface water.

## 2. Soft and Hard Water Classification

### Soft Water:
- Lathers easily with soap.
- Low levels of calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions.
- **Examples**: Rainwater, distilled water.

### Hard Water:
- Does not lather easily with soap due to the presence of high levels of calcium and magnesium ions.
- Requires more soap to form foam and often leaves behind soap scum.
- **Examples**: Well water, river water in limestone regions.

#### Soap Test:
- **Soft Water**: Forms foam quickly when mixed with soap.
- **Hard Water**: Forms less foam or none at all, leaving behind soap scum.

---

## 3. Salts Causing Water Hardness

The main salts responsible for water hardness include:
- **Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃)**
- **Magnesium Carbonate (MgCO₃)**
- **Calcium Sulfate (CaSO₄)**
- **Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO₄)**

These salts, when dissolved in water, increase the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions, which results in water hardness.

---

## 4. Unit of Hardness

Water hardness is typically measured in **ppm (parts per million)** or **mg/L** of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).

### Hardness Classification:
- **Soft Water**: Less than 60 mg/L of CaCO₃
- **Moderately Hard Water**: 60 - 120 mg/L of CaCO₃
- **Hard Water**: 120 - 180 mg/L of CaCO₃
- **Very Hard Water**: Above 180 mg/L of CaCO₃

---

## 5. Numerical Problems on Water Hardness

#### Problem:
The hardness of water is found to be 200 mg/L of CaCO₃. Classify the water as soft, moderately hard, hard, or very hard.

#### Solution:
- **Given**: Hardness = 200 mg/L of CaCO₃
- **Classification**: Since 200 mg/L > 180 mg/L, the water is classified as **Very Hard**.

This problem illustrates the classification of water hardness based on the concentration of calcium carbonate.

## 1. Cause of Poor Lathering of Soap in Hard Water

When soap is added to hard water, it does not lather well. This is due to the presence of **calcium (Ca²⁺)** and **magnesium (Mg²⁺)** ions in the water, which react with soap to form **insoluble salts** known as **soap scum**. 

### Explanation:
- Hard water contains dissolved **calcium** and **magnesium** salts, which combine with the soap to form **calcium soap (CaC₁₂H₂₁O₂)** and **magnesium soap (MgC₁₂H₂₁O₂)**, which are insoluble in water.
- These **insoluble salts** prevent the soap from forming lather, causing it to be used up more quickly and resulting in poor foam formation.

---

## 2. Problems Caused by Hard Water in Boilers

### a) Scale and Sludge Formation:
- **Scale**: When hard water is heated in a boiler, **calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)** and **magnesium carbonate (MgCO₃)** precipitate out and form a hard, insulating layer known as **scale**.
- **Sludge**: In boilers, **sludge** refers to the precipitate of salts that can accumulate at the bottom of the boiler and interfere with the heating process.

#### Problems Caused:
- **Scale** reduces heat transfer efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and possible overheating of the boiler.
- **Sludge** can clog the system and reduce water flow, further decreasing boiler efficiency.

### b) Foaming and Priming:
- **Foaming**: Hard water in boilers can cause **foaming**, where the water forms bubbles that may carry water into the steam line.
- **Priming**: This occurs when water, instead of steam, is carried into the steam lines, causing water hammer and potentially damaging the system.

### c) Corrosion:
- The presence of **dissolved oxygen** and **hardness salts** in the water can lead to corrosion of boiler tubes, pipes, and other parts, reducing the lifespan of the boiler.

## 3. Quantitative Measurement of Water Hardness by EDTA Method

The **EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)** method is a widely used technique to measure the hardness of water.

### Procedure:
1. A known volume of hard water is taken.
2. **pH** is adjusted to around **10** using a buffer solution.
3. **Eriochrome Black T** (an indicator) is added, which changes color when it binds with calcium and magnesium ions.
4. **EDTA solution** is added to bind with the calcium and magnesium ions.
5. The volume of EDTA required to completely react with the hardness-causing ions is measured.

### Formula:
The hardness (in ppm or mg/L as CaCO₃) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Hardness} = \frac{\text{Volume of EDTA} \times \text{Concentration of EDTA} \times 1000}{\text{Volume of sample}}
\]

## 4. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and Alkalinity Estimation

### Total Dissolved Solids (TDS):
- **TDS** refers to the total concentration of dissolved substances in water, including salts, minerals, and organic matter.
- TDS is measured in **mg/L** or **ppm**.

#### Method for Estimation:
- **TDS is measured** by evaporating a known volume of water and weighing the remaining residue. The formula used is:

\[
\text{TDS} = \frac{\text{Mass of residue}}{\text{Volume of sample}} \times 1000
\]

### Alkalinity Estimation:
- **Alkalinity** refers to the ability of water to neutralize acids, mainly due to the presence of bicarbonates (HCO₃⁻), carbonates (CO₃²⁻), and hydroxides (OH⁻).
  
#### Procedure:
1. A known volume of water is taken.
2. A **strong acid** (like HCl) is added slowly.
3. The **pH** of the water is monitored, and the volume of acid required to neutralize the alkalinity is measured.

#### Formula for Alkalinity:
\[
\text{Alkalinity} = \frac{\text{Volume of acid} \times \text{Normality of acid} \times 1000}{\text{Volume of sample}}
\]

## 1. Water Softening Techniques

Water softening is the process of removing calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions from hard water to make it more suitable for domestic and industrial use.

### a) Soda Lime Process
- **Process**: Involves adding sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) to hard water. The calcium and magnesium ions react with sodium carbonate, forming insoluble precipitates of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO₃), which can be removed.
- **Reaction**:
\[
  \text{Ca}^{2+} (\text{aq}) + \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 (\text{aq}) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3 (\text{s}) + 2 \text{Na}^+ (\text{aq})
\]
  - **Ca²⁺**: Calcium ion (found in hard water)
  - **Na₂CO₃**: Sodium carbonate (added to the water)
  - **CaCO₃**: Calcium carbonate (precipitates as a solid, removed from water)
  - **Na⁺**: Sodium ion (remains dissolved in water)

- **Explanation**: When **sodium carbonate** is added to hard water, **calcium ions (Ca²⁺)** react with it to form **calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)**, which is an **insoluble solid** and precipitates out of the water. This helps in softening the water by removing hardness-causing ions.

---

### b) Zeolite Process
- **Process**: Zeolite (natural or synthetic alumino-silicate) is used to remove hardness-causing calcium and magnesium ions. The zeolite absorbs these ions and releases sodium ions in exchange.
- **Reaction**:
\[
  \text{Ca}^{2+} + 2\text{Na}^+ \text{(zeolite)} \rightarrow \text{Ca-zeolite} + 2\text{Na}^+
\]
- **Uses**: Zeolite process is commonly used in industrial applications for large-scale water softening.

---

### c) Ion Exchange Process
- **Process**: Water is passed through ion-exchange resins. These resins exchange sodium ions (Na⁺) for calcium and magnesium ions. The process regenerates the resin using a salt solution.
- **Types of Ion Exchange**:
  - **Cation Exchange**: Replaces Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ with Na⁺.
  - **Anion Exchange**: Used to remove unwanted anions.
- **Uses**: Primarily used in industries and for producing deionized water.

## 2. Municipal Water Treatment

Municipal water treatment ensures that the water supplied for drinking and other purposes is free from harmful microorganisms and impurities.

### a) Sedimentation
- **Process**: The process where larger particles in water settle down due to gravity. It is the first stage of treatment where heavy solids (like sand, silt, and debris) are removed.
  
### b) Coagulation
- **Process**: Coagulants (like aluminum sulfate) are added to water to help small particles clump together and form larger aggregates (called flocs) that can be removed.

### c) Filtration
- **Process**: The water passes through filters, which could be made of sand, gravel, or activated charcoal, to remove remaining fine particles and impurities.
  
### d) Sterilization
- **Process**: The water is disinfected using methods like chlorination, ozone treatment, or UV radiation to kill harmful microorganisms and bacteria before it is supplied for consumption.
