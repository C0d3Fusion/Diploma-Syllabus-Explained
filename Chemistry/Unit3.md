## 1. Natural Occurrence of Metals

Metals occur naturally in the earth's crust in the form of **minerals** and **ores**. The extraction of metals from these minerals is a vital part of metallurgy.

### a) **Minerals**
- Minerals are naturally occurring compounds of metals, often mixed with impurities. 
- Example: Bauxite is a mineral containing aluminum.

### b) **Ores of Common Metals**
- Iron: Haematite is the primary ore for extracting iron.
- Aluminum: Bauxite is the main ore for extracting aluminum.
- Copper: Copper pyrite is the main ore for extracting copper.

### c) **Gangue (Matrix)**
- Gangue refers to the unwanted minerals or impurities present in an ore.
- Example: In haematite, gangue could be silica.

### d) **Flux**
- A flux is a substance added during the extraction of metals to remove impurities or gangue.
- Example: Lime is commonly used as flux in the extraction of iron.

### e) **Slag**
- Slag is the waste material formed during the extraction of metal when flux reacts with gangue.
- Example: In the extraction of iron, slag is formed from the combination of lime and silica.

## 2. Metallurgy: General Principles

Metallurgy is the science and process of extracting metals from their ores and refining them. The general principles of metallurgy include:

- **Concentration of ore**: Removal of impurities (gangue) from the ore.
- **Reduction**: Conversion of metal oxides to metals by removing oxygen.
- **Refining**: Purification of metals.

## 3. Extraction of Metals

### a) **Extraction of Iron from Haematite Ore Using Blast Furnace**

The extraction of iron from haematite ore is done using a **blast furnace**. The process involves several steps:

1. **Raw Materials**: 
   - Haematite ore.
   - Coke as a fuel and reducing agent.
   - Limestone as flux.
   - Hot air is blown into the furnace.

2. **Reactions**:
   - Haematite reacts with coke to produce iron and carbon dioxide:
     - Iron ore (haematite) + Coke → Iron + Carbon dioxide  
   - Limestone decomposes to form lime and carbon dioxide:
     - Limestone → Lime + Carbon dioxide  
   - Lime reacts with silica to form slag:
     - Lime + Silica → Slag  

3. **Process**:
   - Coke is burned in the furnace, producing carbon dioxide, which reacts with iron ore to reduce it to metallic iron.
   - Limestone acts as a flux, combining with impurities (like silica) to form slag, which floats on top of molten iron.

### b) **Extraction of Aluminium from Bauxite**

Aluminum is extracted from **bauxite ore** through a process called the **Bayer process**.

1. **Steps**:
   - Bauxite is dissolved in sodium hydroxide to form soluble sodium aluminate.
   - Aluminum hydroxide is precipitated from the solution and heated to produce pure aluminum oxide.
   - The aluminum oxide is reduced to aluminum metal in a furnace.

2. **Reaction**:
   - Bauxite + Sodium hydroxide → Sodium aluminate + Impurities  
   - Sodium aluminate + Water → Aluminum hydroxide  
   - Aluminum hydroxide (heated) → Aluminum oxide  
   - Aluminum oxide + Carbon → Aluminum + Carbon dioxide

## 4. Alloys

An **alloy** is a mixture of a metal with other metals or non-metals to enhance its properties such as strength, hardness, or corrosion resistance.

### a) **Purposes of Alloying**
- **Improved strength**: Alloys are stronger than pure metals.
- **Improved hardness**: Alloys like steel are harder and more durable.
- **Corrosion resistance**: Some alloys resist rusting or corrosion.
- **Special properties**: Such as electrical conductivity or magnetism.

### b) **Ferrous Alloys**
Ferrous alloys are alloys that contain iron as the main component.

- **Cast Iron**: Contains about 2–4% carbon. It is strong in compression but brittle.
- **Steel**: Contains less carbon than cast iron. It is strong, durable, and used in construction, automotive, and manufacturing industries.

### c) **Non-Ferrous Alloys**
Non-ferrous alloys do not contain iron. Examples include:
- Brass: An alloy of copper and zinc, used for its corrosion resistance and appearance.
- Bronze: An alloy of copper and tin, used for its hardness and resistance to corrosion.
- Aluminum alloys: Made with aluminum and other elements like copper or magnesium, used in aerospace and automotive industries.

### d) **Properties and Applications of Alloys**
- Steel: Strong, durable, used in construction, tools, and machines.
- Brass: Corrosion-resistant, used in electrical fittings and instruments.
- Bronze: Tough and wear-resistant, used in machinery parts and sculptures.
