# Natural Occurrence of Metals

## 1. Minerals and Ores of Metals
- **Minerals:** Naturally occurring compounds containing metals, usually found in the Earth’s crust.
- **Ore:** A type of mineral that contains enough metal to be economically extracted.

### Ores of Important Metals:
- **Iron Ore:** Hematite (Fe₂O₃), Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)
- **Aluminium Ore:** Bauxite (Al₂O₃·2H₂O)
- **Copper Ore:** Chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂), Malachite (Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂)

## 2. Gangue (Matrix) and Flux
- **Gangue (Matrix):** The unwanted impurities present in ores, which are removed during the extraction process.
- **Flux:** A substance added during extraction to help remove impurities (gangue) by forming a slag. Flux helps in lowering the melting point of impurities.
- **Slag:** The waste product formed after the impurities combine with flux and separate from the metal.

# Metallurgy

## 1. General Principles of Metallurgy:
Metallurgy is the process of extracting metals from their ores and refining them for industrial use. The general steps include:
1. **Crushing and grinding** of ores to reduce their size.
2. **Concentration** of ores by methods like froth flotation, magnetic separation, or gravity separation.
3. **Reduction** of metals to separate them from oxygen or other elements (e.g., using carbon or electrolysis).
4. **Refining** to remove impurities and obtain pure metals.

## 2. Extraction of Metals

### **Iron Extraction from Hematite Ore (Blast Furnace Process)**

- **Reaction:**
  - **Fe₂O₃ (Hematite)** reacts with **carbon (C)** to produce **iron (Fe)** and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**:
    ```markdown
    Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO₂
    ```

  - **Step-by-step Process:**
    1. **Iron Ore (Hematite)** is mixed with coke and limestone in the blast furnace.
    2. **Coke** is heated in the presence of oxygen, producing carbon monoxide (CO) as the reducing agent.
    3. The carbon monoxide reduces iron ore to iron:
      ```markdown
      Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂
      ```

    4. **Limestone (CaCO₃)** is used to remove impurities, forming calcium silicate (slag):
      ```markdown
      CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂
      CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃ (slag)
      ```

    5. The molten iron sinks to the bottom of the furnace, while slag floats on top.

### **Aluminium Extraction from Bauxite (Bayer Process)**

- **Reaction:**
  - **Bauxite (Al₂O₃·2H₂O)** is first converted to **Al₂O₃ (alumina)** by refining.
  - Alumina is then reduced to aluminium using electrolysis:
    ```markdown
    2Al₂O₃ → 4Al + 3O₂ (electrolytic reduction)
    ```

  - **Electrolyte:** A mixture of molten **cryolite (Na₃AlF₆)** and **alumina (Al₂O₃)**.
  - At the cathode, aluminium metal is deposited:
    ```markdown
    Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al (at cathode)
    ```

  - At the anode, oxygen gas is released:
    ```markdown
    2O²⁻ → O₂ + 4e⁻ (at anode)
    ```
