## 1. Fuels

### a) **Definition**
A **fuel** is a substance that releases energy, primarily heat, when it undergoes combustion.

### b) **Combustion of Fuel**
Combustion is the process where a fuel reacts with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of heat and light.  
- Example: Carbon + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Heat  

### c) **Classification of Fuels**
Fuels are classified based on their physical state:
1. **Solid Fuels**: Coal, wood.
2. **Liquid Fuels**: Petrol, diesel.
3. **Gaseous Fuels**: LPG, CNG.

## 2. Calorific Value of Fuels

### a) **Definition**
- **Calorific Value** is the amount of heat produced when a unit mass of fuel is burned completely.  
- **Higher Calorific Value (HCV)**: Total heat obtained including the latent heat of steam.  
- **Lower Calorific Value (LCV)**: Heat obtained after deducting the latent heat of steam.  

### b) **Dulong's Formula**
Dulong's formula calculates the calorific value of a fuel based on its chemical composition:  
\[
\text{HCV (kcal/kg)} = 8080 \times C + 34500 \times H - 2240 \times O + 2200 \times S
\]
Where:  
- C = Percentage of carbon in fuel.  
- H = Percentage of hydrogen in fuel.  
- O = Percentage of oxygen in fuel.  
- S = Percentage of sulfur in fuel.

2. **Volatile Matter**: Indicates the amount of gases released during combustion.  
3. **Ash Content**: Represents non-combustible residues.  
4. **Fixed Carbon**: The solid fuel portion available for combustion.

## 4. Fuel Rating: Octane and Cetane Numbers

### a) **Octane Number**
- Measures the **anti-knocking** property of petrol.
