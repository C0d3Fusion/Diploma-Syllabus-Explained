# Fuels and Combustion

## Definition of Fuel:
A **fuel** is any substance that can undergo combustion (reacting with oxygen) to release energy in the form of heat or light.

## Combustion of Fuel:
- **Combustion** is a chemical reaction between a fuel and oxygen that produces heat and often light. The general reaction is: Fuel + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + Heat

## Classification of Fuels:
- **Primary Fuels:** Found in nature (coal, natural gas, petroleum).
- **Secondary Fuels:** Derived from primary fuels (charcoal, coke, kerosene).
- **Renewable Fuels:** Can be replenished naturally (biomass, biogas, ethanol).
- **Non-renewable Fuels:** Cannot be replenished easily (coal, petroleum).

## Calorific Values (HCV and LCV):
- **Higher Calorific Value (HCV):** The total heat released when a fuel is completely combusted and the products are cooled to room temperature.
- **Lower Calorific Value (LCV):** The heat released when the products of combustion remain at the temperature of combustion (water vapor is not condensed).

### Calculation of HCV and LCV using Dulong’s Formula:
- **Dulong’s Formula:**
- HCV = 81.8C + 344.1H - 25.5O

Where: 
- **C** = Carbon content of the fuel
- **H** = Hydrogen content of the fuel
- **O** = Oxygen content of the fuel

For LCV, subtract the latent heat of water vapor from HCV.

## Proximate Analysis of Coal:
Proximate analysis of coal involves determining the following components:
- **Moisture content**
- **Volatile matter**
- **Ash content**
- **Fixed carbon**

## Fuel Rating (Octane and Cetane Numbers):

- **Octane Number**: A measure of the resistance of a fuel to knocking in gasoline engines. Higher octane values indicate better fuel performance.
- **Cetane Number**: A measure of the ignition quality of diesel fuel. Higher cetane numbers indicate easier ignition and better combustion in diesel engines.

## Chemical Composition, Calorific Values, and Applications of Different Fuels:

### 1. **LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas):**
- **Composition**: Primarily propane (C₃H₈) and butane (C₄H₁₀).
- **Calorific Value**: Around 46 MJ/kg.
- **Applications**: Used in domestic cooking, heating, and as a vehicle fuel.

### 2. **CNG (Compressed Natural Gas):**
- **Composition**: Primarily methane (CH₄).
- **Calorific Value**: Around 55 MJ/kg.
- **Applications**: Used in vehicles, heating, and industrial processes.

### 3. **Water Gas:**
- **Composition**: A mixture of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon monoxide (CO).
- **Calorific Value**: Around 12-13 MJ/m³.
- **Applications**: Used in the chemical industry and for heating.

### 4. **Coal Gas:**
- **Composition**: A mixture of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.
- **Calorific Value**: Around 15-20 MJ/m³.
- **Applications**: Used in lighting, heating, and industrial processes.

### 5. **Producer Gas:**
- **Composition**: A mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen.
- **Calorific Value**: Around 5-6 MJ/m³.
- **Applications**: Used in industrial heating and as a fuel for gas engines.

### 6. **Biogas:**
- **Composition**: Primarily methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).
- **Calorific Value**: Around 22-30 MJ/m³.
- **Applications**: Used for cooking, heating, and power generation.

# Lubrication

## Function and Characteristics of a Good Lubricant:
A **lubricant** is a substance used to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces heat generation and wear. A good lubricant should:
- **Reduce friction** and wear
- **Provide cooling** to the machine parts
- **Form a protective layer** on surfaces
- **Seal surfaces** to prevent the ingress of dirt

## Classification of Lubricants:
1. **Solid Lubricants**: Graphite, molybdenum disulfide.
2. **Liquid Lubricants**: Mineral oils, synthetic oils.
3. **Semi-solid Lubricants**: Greases, gels.
4. **Gas Lubricants**: Air and nitrogen in high-speed machinery.

## Lubrication Mechanism:
- **Hydrodynamic Lubrication**: Occurs when the lubricant creates a full film between two surfaces in motion, preventing contact and reducing friction.
- **Boundary Lubrication**: Occurs when the lubricant film is too thin, and the surfaces experience some level of contact.

## Physical Properties of Lubricants:
1. **Viscosity**: Resistance to flow. Higher viscosity oils are thicker and better for high-load conditions.
2. **Viscosity Index**: Indicates how much the viscosity of oil changes with temperature. A high viscosity index means less change in viscosity with temperature.
3. **Oiliness**: The ability of a lubricant to adhere to surfaces, preventing metal-to-metal contact.
4. **Flash Point**: The temperature at which a lubricant produces enough vapor to form a flammable mixture with air.
5. **Fire Point**: The temperature at which a lubricant will sustain combustion.
6. **Cloud Point and Pour Point**: The lowest temperature at which a lubricant remains fluid and can flow.

## Chemical Properties of Lubricants:
1. **Coke Number**: Indicates the tendency of a lubricant to form solid carbon deposits.
2. **Total Acid Number (TAN)**: Measures the amount of acidic substances in the lubricant, which can cause corrosion.
3. **Saponification Value**: Indicates the amount of alkali required to neutralize the fatty acids in the lubricant.
