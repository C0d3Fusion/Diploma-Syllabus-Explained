## 1. **Electronic Concept of Oxidation, Reduction, and Redox Reactions**

### a) **Oxidation**
- Oxidation is the loss of electrons by a substance during a chemical reaction.  
- **Example**: Sodium atoms lose electrons and form positive sodium ions.

### b) **Reduction**
- Reduction is the gain of electrons by a substance during a chemical reaction.  
- **Example**: Chlorine molecules gain electrons to form negative chloride ions.

### c) **Redox Reaction**
- A redox reaction is a combination of oxidation and reduction processes happening at the same time.  
- **Example**: When sodium reacts with chlorine, sodium loses electrons (oxidation), and chlorine gains those electrons (reduction) to form sodium chloride (common salt).

## 2. **Definition of Key Terms**

### a) **Electrolytes**
- Substances that conduct electricity in their molten state or when dissolved in water by producing ions.  
- **Example**: Common salt and sulfuric acid.

### b) **Non-Electrolytes**
- Substances that do not conduct electricity because they do not produce ions in water or molten state.  
- **Example**: Sugar and distilled water.

## 3. **Faraday's Laws of Electrolysis**

Faraday's laws explain how the quantity of substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is related to the amount of electric current passed through the electrolyte.

### a) **First Law of Electrolysis**
- The mass of a substance deposited or dissolved at an electrode is directly proportional to the total electric charge passed through the electrolyte.  

**Formula**:  
Mass = Electrochemical equivalent ร Total charge passed  

### b) **Second Law of Electrolysis**
- When the same quantity of electricity is passed through different electrolytes, the mass of substances deposited or dissolved is proportional to their chemical equivalent weights.

### c) **Example Problem**
**Question**: How much copper is deposited if 96500 coulombs of charge pass through copper sulfate solution?  
**Solution**:  
1. Copper equivalent weight = 63.5 รท 2 = 31.75  
2. Mass deposited = 31.75 grams.

## 4. **Industrial Applications of Electrolysis**

### a) **Electrometallurgy**
- Electrolysis is used to extract metals from their ores.  
- **Example**: Aluminum is extracted from bauxite using electrolysis.

### b) **Electroplating**
- Electroplating is the process of coating a metal object with a thin layer of another metal to improve its appearance, prevent corrosion, or increase its strength.  
- **Example**: Coating iron spoons with silver.  
  - The iron spoon is connected as the negative terminal (cathode).  
  - The metal to be deposited (silver) is connected as the positive terminal (anode).  
  - The electrolyte is a solution containing ions of the depositing metal (silver nitrate solution).

### c) **Electrolytic Refining**
- This is the process of purifying impure metals using electrolysis.  
- **Example**: In the refining of copper:  
  - Impure copper is used as the positive terminal (anode).  
  - Pure copper is used as the negative terminal (cathode).  
  - The electrolyte is a solution of copper sulfate.
