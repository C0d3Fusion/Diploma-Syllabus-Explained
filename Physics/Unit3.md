## Work

### Concept
- **Definition**: Work is said to be done when a force is applied to an object, and the object moves in the direction of the force.
- **Formula**:  
\[
  W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos\theta
\]
  Where:  
  - W = Work (in joules, J)  
  - F = Force applied (in newtons, N)  
  - d = Displacement (in meters, m)  
  - \theta = Angle between force and displacement  

### Units and Dimensions
- **SI Unit**: Joule (J)  
- **1 Joule**: Work done when a force of 1 N displaces an object by 1 m in the direction of the force.  
- **CGS Unit**: Erg (1 Joule = 10^7 erg)  
- **Dimensions**: [M L^2 T^{-2}]

### Types of Work
1. **Zero Work**: When \theta = 90^\circ, no displacement occurs in the direction of the force.  
   Example: Carrying a bag horizontally.
2. **Positive Work**: When \theta < 90^\circ, the displacement is in the direction of the force.  
   Example: Pushing an object forward.
3. **Negative Work**: When \theta > 90^\circ, displacement occurs opposite to the direction of the force.  
   Example: Friction opposing motion.

### Work on Horizontal and Inclined Planes
1. **Horizontal Surface**:  
\[
   W = F \cdot d
\]
2. **Inclined Plane**:  
   - **Rough Surface**: Includes friction (f = \mu N)  
\[
     W = (F - f) \cdot d
\]
   - **Smooth Surface**: Neglects friction  
\[
     W = F \cdot d
\]

## Friction

### Concept
- **Definition**: Friction is the resisting force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces in contact.
  
### Types of Friction
1. **Static Friction**: Acts when an object is at rest.
2. **Kinetic Friction**: Acts when an object is in motion.
3. **Rolling Friction**: Acts when an object rolls over a surface.

### Laws of Limiting Friction
1. Friction is proportional to the normal force (f \propto N).
2. It depends on the nature of surfaces.
3. Friction is independent of the area of contact.

### Coefficient of Friction
- **Formula**:  
\[
  \mu = \frac{f}{N}
\]
  Where:  
  - \mu = Coefficient of friction (dimensionless)  
  - f = Friction force  
  - N = Normal force  

### Reducing Friction and Applications
- **Methods**: Lubrication, polishing, using wheels or rollers.
- **Applications**: Braking systems, machinery, transportation.

## Energy

### Types of Energy
1. **Kinetic Energy**: Energy of a moving object.
2. **Potential Energy**: Energy due to position or configuration.
3. **Mechanical Energy**: Sum of kinetic and potential energy.

### Kinetic Energy
- **Formula**:  
\[
  KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]
  Where:  
  - m = Mass (in kg)  
  - v = Velocity (in m/s)

### Gravitational Potential Energy
- **Formula**:  
\[
  PE = mgh
\]
  Where:  
  - m = Mass (in kg)  
  - g = Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 \, m/s^2)  
  - h = Height (in m)

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy
- **Statement**: The total mechanical energy of a system remains constant if only conservative forces act on it.  
\[
  KE + PE = \text{Constant}
\]

### Transformation of Energy
Examples:  
- A pendulum converting potential energy to kinetic energy.  
- Hydropower plants converting gravitational energy to electrical energy.

## Power

### Concept
- **Definition**: Power is the rate at which work is done.  
- **Formula**:  
\[
  P = \frac{W}{t}
\]
  Where:  
  - P = Power (in watts, W)  
  - W = Work (in joules, J)  
  - t = Time (in seconds, s)

### Units and Dimensions
- **SI Unit**: Watt (W)  
- **1 Watt**: Power when 1 joule of work is done in 1 second.  
- **Dimensions**: [M L^2 T^{-3}]

### Numerical Problems
1. **Example**: Calculate the power of a machine that does 500 J of work in 10 seconds.  
\[
   P = \frac{500}{10} = 50 \, W
\]
