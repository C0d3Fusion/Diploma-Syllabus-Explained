# Work and Energy

## Work

### Concept:
- **Work** is done when a force acts on an object and causes a displacement in the direction of the applied force.
- Formula: **Work (W) = Force (F) × Displacement (d) × cos(θ)**

### Units:
- The SI unit of work is **Joule (J)**, where 1 Joule = 1 Newton × 1 Meter.

### Examples of Work:
1. **Zero Work**: 
   - If the force applied is perpendicular to the direction of displacement, such as a person carrying a bag while walking on a level surface.
2. **Positive Work**:
   - When the force and displacement are in the same direction, such as pushing a car forward.
3. **Negative Work**:
   - When the force and displacement are in opposite directions, such as friction acting on a moving object.

## Friction

### Concept:
- **Friction** is the resistive force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces in contact.

### Types of Friction:
1. **Static Friction**: The frictional force that resists the initiation of motion between two objects.
2. **Kinetic Friction**: The frictional force that opposes the motion of two objects sliding past each other.
3. **Rolling Friction**: The frictional force that resists the rolling of an object on a surface.

### Laws of Limiting Friction:
1. **The force of friction is directly proportional to the normal force**: 
   - **F_friction = μ × N**, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force.
2. **The limiting friction is independent of the area of contact**.
3. **The limiting friction is independent of the speed of motion until a certain limit is reached**.

### Coefficient of Friction (μ):
- It is the ratio of the force of friction to the normal force.
  - Formula: **μ = F_friction / N**

### Reducing Friction:
- Friction can be reduced by:
  1. Using lubricants.
  2. Polishing the surfaces.
  3. Using ball bearings.
  
### Engineering Applications:
- Friction plays a role in applications such as brakes, tires, and machines. In some cases, friction is reduced to improve performance, while in others it is essential, such as in vehicle tires and brake systems.

### Work Done in Moving an Object on Horizontal and Inclined Planes:
- On a **horizontal plane**, the work done against friction is **W = F_friction × d**.
- On an **inclined plane**, the work done depends on the angle of inclination and friction force acting on the object.

### Related Applications:
- Work done against friction is important in various applications such as transportation, machinery, and mechanical systems.

## Energy

### Concept:
- **Energy** is the capacity to do work.

### Units:
- The SI unit of energy is **Joule (J)**.

### Types of Energy:
1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)**:
   - The energy possessed by an object due to its motion.
   - Formula: **KE = 1/2 mv²**
2. **Gravitational Potential Energy (PE)**:
   - The energy possessed by an object due to its height above the ground.
   - Formula: **PE = mgh**, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height.

### Derivations:
- Kinetic Energy: If an object is moving with velocity **v** and has mass **m**, the kinetic energy is derived from the work done to accelerate the object.
- Gravitational Potential Energy: The work done to lift an object against gravity is stored as potential energy.

## Mechanical Energy

- **Mechanical Energy** is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy in a system.
  - Formula: **Mechanical Energy = KE + PE**

### Conservation of Mechanical Energy for Freely Falling Bodies:
- The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) of a freely falling object remains constant, assuming no air resistance.

## Transformation of Energy:
- **Energy Transformation** refers to the process of changing one form of energy to another.
  - Example: A moving car transforms its **kinetic energy** into **heat energy** due to friction in the brakes.

## Power

### Concept:
- **Power** is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
  - Formula: **Power (P) = Work (W) / Time (t)**

### Units:
- The SI unit of power is **Watt (W)**, where 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second.

### Power and Work Relationship:
- Power is directly related to work and time. The more work done in less time, the higher the power.
  
### Calculation of Power:
- For an object of mass **m** moving with velocity **v**, the power required to move it can be calculated as:
  - **P = F × v**, where F is the force and v is the velocity.

### Numerical Problems:
1. **Example Problem**: 
   - If a 10 kg object moves with a velocity of 5 m/s and experiences a force of 20 N, the power required is:
     - **P = F × v = 20 × 5 = 100 W**
