# Translational and Rotational Motion

## Translational Motion
- **Translational motion** refers to the movement of an object from one point to another in space, without rotation.
- **Example**: A car moving along a straight road.

### Characteristics of Translational Motion:
- **Displacement**: The change in the position of the object.
- **Velocity**: The rate of change of displacement.
- **Acceleration**: The rate of change of velocity.

## Rotational Motion
- **Rotational motion** refers to the motion of an object around an axis, where every point on the object moves in a circular path.
- **Example**: A wheel rotating about its axis.

### Characteristics of Rotational Motion:
- **Angular Displacement**: The angle through which an object rotates.
- **Angular Velocity**: The rate of change of angular displacement.
- **Angular Acceleration**: The rate of change of angular velocity.

# Torque and Angular Momentum

## Torque
- **Torque** (τ) is the measure of the rotational force applied to an object. It causes an object to rotate about an axis.
- Formula: **τ = r × F**, where:
  - **r** = Position vector (distance from axis of rotation to point of force application)
  - **F** = Force applied

### Example of Torque:
- A person applying a force to a door to open it; the torque causes the door to rotate around its hinges.

## Angular Momentum
- **Angular Momentum (L)** is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. It is the product of the moment of inertia (I) and the angular velocity (ω).
- Formula: **L = I × ω**, where:
  - **I** = Moment of inertia
  - **ω** = Angular velocity

### Example of Angular Momentum:
- A rotating ice skater spins faster as they pull their arms inward, conserving angular momentum.

## Conservation of Angular Momentum
- **Conservation of Angular Momentum** states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum remains constant.
- **Formula**: **I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂**, where:
  - **I₁** and **ω₁** are the initial moment of inertia and angular velocity
  - **I₂** and **ω₂** are the final moment of inertia and angular velocity

### Applications:
1. **Ice Skating**: A skater pulls their arms in to spin faster, conserving angular momentum.
2. **Planets orbiting the Sun**: The angular momentum of a planet is conserved as it orbits in an elliptical path.

# Moment of Inertia

## Moment of Inertia (I)
- **Moment of inertia** is the rotational inertia of an object, representing its resistance to changes in its rotational motion.
- Formula: **I = Σmᵢrᵢ²**, where:
  - **mᵢ** = Mass of the point
  - **rᵢ** = Distance of the point from the axis of rotation

### Physical Significance:
- The moment of inertia depends on both the mass distribution of the object and the axis about which it rotates.

## Radius of Gyration (k)
- **Radius of gyration** is the distance from the axis of rotation at which the entire mass of the object can be considered to be concentrated, in terms of its moment of inertia.
- Formula: **I = mk²**, where:
  - **m** = Mass of the object
  - **k** = Radius of gyration

# Theorems of Parallel and Perpendicular Axes

## Parallel Axis Theorem
- The moment of inertia of an object about an axis parallel to an axis through its center of mass is given by:
  - **I = I_cm + md²**, where:
    - **I_cm** = Moment of inertia about the center of mass
    - **m** = Mass of the object
    - **d** = Distance between the center of mass and the axis of rotation

## Perpendicular Axis Theorem
- The moment of inertia of a planar object about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the object is the sum of its moments of inertia about two perpendicular axes in the plane:
  - **I = Iₓ + Iᵧ**, where:
    - **Iₓ** = Moment of inertia about the x-axis
    - **Iᵧ** = Moment of inertia about the y-axis

# Moment of Inertia of Common Objects

## Moment of Inertia Formulae:
1. **Rod (about center)**:
   - **I = (1/12)ml²**, where **m** is the mass and **l** is the length of the rod.
2. **Disc (about center)**:
   - **I = (1/2)mr²**, where **m** is the mass and **r** is the radius of the disc.
3. **Ring (about center)**:
   - **I = mr²**, where **m** is the mass and **r** is the radius of the ring.
4. **Solid Sphere (about center)**:
   - **I = (2/5)mr²**, where **m** is the mass and **r** is the radius of the sphere.
5. **Hollow Sphere (about center)**:
   - **I = (2/3)mr²**, where **m** is the mass and **r** is the radius of the sphere.

These formulae are essential for calculating the moment of inertia of different rigid bodies when subjected to rotational motion.
