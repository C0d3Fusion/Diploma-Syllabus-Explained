# Force and Motion

## Scalar and Vector Quantities

### Scalar Quantities:
- Scalar quantities have only magnitude.
- Examples: Mass, temperature, speed, distance.

### Vector Quantities:
- Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction.
- Examples: Force, velocity, acceleration, displacement.

### Representation of a Vector:
- A vector is represented by an arrow. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude, and the direction of the arrow shows the direction of the vector.

## Types of Vectors:
1. **Zero Vector**: A vector with zero magnitude and no specific direction.
2. **Unit Vector**: A vector with magnitude 1, used to specify direction.
3. **Position Vector**: The vector that represents the position of a point relative to the origin.
4. **Equal Vectors**: Vectors with the same magnitude and direction.
5. **Negative Vector**: A vector that has the same magnitude but opposite direction.

## Addition and Subtraction of Vectors:
- Vectors are added or subtracted using the **Triangle Law** or **Parallelogram Law**.

### Triangle Law (Statement Only):
- If two vectors are represented by two sides of a triangle in magnitude and direction, their sum is represented by the third side of the triangle in the same direction.

### Parallelogram Law (Statement Only):
- If two vectors are represented in magnitude and direction by two adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then their sum is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram.

## Scalar and Vector Product:
1. **Scalar Product (Dot Product)**:
   - The product of two vectors that results in a scalar quantity.
   - Formula: **A · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)**

2. **Vector Product (Cross Product)**:
   - The product of two vectors that results in a vector quantity.
   - Formula: **A × B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n**

## Resolution of a Vector:
- A vector can be resolved into two components, usually along the x and y axes. This is important in analyzing motion in inclined planes and other complex systems.

### Applications to Inclined Plane and Lawn Roller:
- In the case of an inclined plane, the weight of the object is resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface.
- A lawn roller's motion involves the resolution of its weight to understand the force distribution.

## Force and Momentum

### Force:
- **Force** is an interaction that causes an object to change its state of motion or rest. It has both magnitude and direction.

### Momentum:
- **Momentum** (p) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object.
  - Formula: **p = mv**

### Conservation of Linear Momentum:
- **Statement**: The total momentum of a system remains constant if no external force acts on the system.
- **Derivation**:
  - If a system has no external force, the momentum before and after the interaction remains the same.

### Applications of Conservation of Momentum:
1. **Recoil of Gun**: When a gun is fired, the gun moves backward (recoil) to conserve momentum.
2. **Rockets**: The momentum of exhaust gases expelled backward results in the forward motion of the rocket.

### Impulse:
- **Impulse** is the change in momentum, and it is equal to the force applied multiplied by the time it is applied.
  - Formula: **Impulse = Force × Time**

## Circular Motion

### Angular Displacement:
- The angle through which an object moves in a circular path.

### Angular Velocity:
- The rate at which an object rotates about an axis.
  - Formula: **ω = Δθ / Δt**

### Angular Acceleration:
- The rate of change of angular velocity.
  - Formula: **α = Δω / Δt**

### Frequency and Time Period:
- **Frequency** is the number of complete revolutions per unit time.
  - Formula: **f = 1/T**
- **Time Period (T)** is the time taken for one complete revolution.

### Relation Between Linear and Angular Quantities:
- **Linear Velocity (v)**: The velocity of an object moving along a circular path.
  - Formula: **v = ωr**
- **Linear Acceleration (a)**: The acceleration of an object moving along a circular path.
  - Formula: **a = αr**

### Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces:
1. **Centripetal Force**: The force that acts towards the center of the circular path.
   - Formula: **F = mv² / r**
2. **Centrifugal Force**: The apparent force that pushes an object outward, observed from a rotating frame of reference.

### Applications:
1. **Banking of Roads**: Roads are banked to allow vehicles to take turns without sliding outward due to centrifugal force.
2. **Bending of Cyclist**: A cyclist leans inward while turning to balance the centrifugal force with the centripetal force.
