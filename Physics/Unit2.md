# Unit 2: Force and Motion

This unit covers the fundamental concepts related to **force**, **motion**, and **vectors**. Key topics include scalar and vector quantities, their representations, vector operations, and applications in solving real-world problems.

## **1. Scalar and Vector Quantities**

- **Scalar Quantities**: These are physical quantities that are described by only a magnitude (numerical value) and do not have a direction.  
  - Examples: Mass, Temperature, Distance, Speed, Time.

- **Vector Quantities**: These are physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction.  
  - Examples: Force, Velocity, Displacement, Acceleration.

## **2. Representation of a Vector**

A vector is usually represented by an arrow, where:
- The **length** of the arrow represents the magnitude.
- The **direction** of the arrow shows the direction of the vector.

Vectors can be represented graphically or using **Cartesian coordinates** (i, j, k) in 3D space.

## **3. Types of Vectors**
- **Zero Vector**: A vector with zero magnitude and undefined direction.
- **Unit Vector**: A vector with a magnitude of 1, used to represent direction.
- **Position Vector**: A vector representing the position of a point in space relative to the origin.
- **Equal Vectors**: Vectors with the same magnitude and direction.
- **Collinear Vectors**: Vectors that lie along the same line.
- **Coplanar Vectors**: Vectors that lie in the same plane.

## **4. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors**

- **Vector Addition**: Vectors can be added using the **Head-to-Tail Method** or **Parallelogram Law**. The sum of two vectors is obtained by joining the tail of the second vector to the head of the first vector.

  **Parallelogram Law** (Statement): If two vectors are represented by the adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then their sum is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram passing through the point of intersection of the vectors.

- **Vector Subtraction**: To subtract one vector from another, we add the negative of the second vector to the first.

## **5. Scalar and Vector Products**
- **Scalar Product (Dot Product)**: The scalar product of two vectors is defined as the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. It results in a scalar quantity.
  
  Formula:  
\[
  A \cdot B = |A| |B| \cos \theta
\]

- **Vector Product (Cross Product)**: The vector product of two vectors results in a vector that is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors.
  
  Formula:  
\[
  A \times B = |A| |B| \sin \theta \, \hat{n}
\]
  where ÓÄÅ\hat{n}ÓÄÅ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of A and B.

## **6. Resolution of a Vector**

- **Resolution of a vector** refers to breaking a vector into two components, usually along the **x-axis** and **y-axis**, in two-dimensional space.
  
  - For a vector ÓÄÅ\vec{A}ÓÄÅ, the components are:
    - ÓÄÅA_x = A \cos \thetaÓÄÅ
    - ÓÄÅA_y = A \sin \thetaÓÄÅ

- This technique is especially useful when applying vectors to real-world problems, such as **inclined planes** or **lawn rollers**, where the motion is broken down into horizontal and vertical components.

## **7. Application to Inclined Plane and Lawn Roller**

- **Inclined Plane**: A vector can be resolved into two components:
  - Parallel to the incline: The component responsible for moving the object down the slope.
  - Perpendicular to the incline: The component responsible for the normal force.
  
  The forces acting on an object on an inclined plane are divided into these components, allowing us to calculate acceleration, velocity, and other quantities.

- **Lawn Roller**: In a lawn roller, the force applied to the roller can be resolved into horizontal and vertical components. This allows us to understand the pressure exerted on the ground and the motion of the roller.

### **Force and Motion**
#### **Scalar and Vector Quantities**
- **Scalar Quantities**: These are physical quantities that have only magnitude and no direction. Examples: mass, temperature, speed.
- **Vector Quantities**: These are physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Examples: displacement, velocity, force.

#### **Representation of Vectors**
- Vectors are represented by an arrow. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the vector, and the length of the arrow represents the magnitude.

#### **Types of Vectors**
- **Unit Vector**: A vector with a magnitude of one.
- **Zero Vector**: A vector with zero magnitude.
- **Position Vector**: The vector representing the position of a point relative to the origin.
- **Equal Vectors**: Vectors that have the same magnitude and direction.
  
#### **Addition and Subtraction of Vectors**
- **Triangle Law of Addition**: When two vectors are represented as the two sides of a triangle, their resultant is the third side taken in reverse order.
- **Parallelogram Law of Addition**: The resultant of two vectors can be found by completing the parallelogram and taking the diagonal as the resultant.

#### **Scalar and Vector Products**
- **Scalar Product (Dot Product)**: The product of two vectors that results in a scalar quantity. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅ\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}| \cos \thetaÓÄÅ
- **Vector Product (Cross Product)**: The product of two vectors that results in another vector. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅ\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B} = |\mathbf{A}| |\mathbf{B}| \sin \theta \hat{n}ÓÄÅ

#### **Resolution of a Vector**
- A vector can be resolved into two perpendicular components, typically along the X and Y axes. This is useful in problems involving inclined planes and lawn rollers.

### **Force, Momentum, and Impulse**
#### **Force**
- **Force** is a push or pull that changes the state of motion of an object. It is calculated using Newton's second law:  
  ÓÄÅF = maÓÄÅ
  where:
  - ÓÄÅFÓÄÅ is force,
  - ÓÄÅmÓÄÅ is mass,
  - ÓÄÅaÓÄÅ is acceleration.

#### **Momentum**
- **Momentum** of an object is the product of its mass and velocity. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅp = mvÓÄÅ

#### **Conservation of Linear Momentum**
- **Statement**: The total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant if no external force acts on it.
  
- **Derivation**:  
  For a system of particles, the momentum is the sum of individual momenta:
  ÓÄÅP = \sum m_i v_iÓÄÅ
  If no external force acts, the momentum is conserved:
  ÓÄÅ\frac{dP}{dt} = 0ÓÄÅ

#### **Impulse**
- **Impulse** is the change in momentum of an object when a force acts on it for a certain time. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅJ = F \Delta t = \Delta pÓÄÅ

#### **Applications**
- **Recoil of Gun**: The gun recoils when fired, and the bullet moves forward with equal and opposite momentum.
- **Rockets**: The propulsion of a rocket involves expelling gas, and the momentum of the rocket and gas is conserved.

### **Circular Motion**
#### **Angular Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration**
- **Angular Displacement**: The angle through which an object moves along a circular path.
- **Angular Velocity**: The rate at which an object moves through an angle. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅ\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}ÓÄÅ
- **Angular Acceleration**: The rate of change of angular velocity. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅ\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}ÓÄÅ

#### **Frequency and Time Period**
- **Frequency (f)**: The number of complete revolutions or cycles in one second. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅf = \frac{1}{T}ÓÄÅ
- **Time Period (T)**: The time it takes to complete one revolution. Formula:  
  ÓÄÅT = \frac{1}{f}ÓÄÅ

#### **Relation Between Linear and Angular Quantities**
- **Linear Velocity (v)** and **Angular Velocity (œâ)**:  
  ÓÄÅv = r \omegaÓÄÅ
- **Linear Acceleration (a)** and **Angular Acceleration (Œ±)**:  
  ÓÄÅa = r \alphaÓÄÅ

#### **Centripetal and Centrifugal Forces**
- **Centripetal Force**: The force acting towards the center of the circular path, calculated as:  
  ÓÄÅF_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}ÓÄÅ
- **Centrifugal Force**: The apparent force acting away from the center in a rotating reference frame.

#### **Applications**
- **Banking of Roads**: Roads are banked to reduce friction during turns.
- **Bending of Cyclist**: Cyclists lean into the turn to balance the forces.
