# Concept of Heat and Temperature

## Heat and Temperature

- **Heat** is a form of energy that flows between systems or objects due to a difference in temperature. It always moves from a higher temperature to a lower temperature.
  - **Unit**: Joules (J) or calories (cal).
  
- **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.
  - **Unit**: Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), Fahrenheit (°F).

# Modes of Heat Transfer

## Conduction

- **Conduction** is the process of heat transfer through direct contact between particles. Heat flows from the hot end to the cold end through molecular collisions.
  - **Example**: Heating one end of a metal rod causes the entire rod to heat up over time.

## Convection

- **Convection** is the transfer of heat in fluids (liquids and gases) through the movement of the fluid itself. As the fluid heats up, it becomes less dense and rises, while cooler fluid sinks, creating convection currents.
  - **Example**: Boiling water in a pot, where the hot water rises and cooler water sinks.

## Radiation

- **Radiation** is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves without the need for a medium. It can occur in a vacuum.
  - **Example**: Heat from the Sun reaching the Earth.

# Specific Heats

- **Specific Heat** (or specific heat capacity) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 unit mass of a substance by 1°C (or 1K).
  - **Formula**: **Q = mcΔT**, where:
    - **Q** = Heat energy absorbed/released
    - **m** = Mass of the substance
    - **c** = Specific heat capacity
    - **ΔT** = Change in temperature
  - **Unit**: Joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C).

# Scales of Temperature and Their Relationship

## Temperature Scales

- **Celsius Scale (°C)**: The temperature scale where 0°C is the freezing point of water and 100°C is the boiling point of water.
- **Fahrenheit Scale (°F)**: The temperature scale where 32°F is the freezing point of water and 212°F is the boiling point of water.
- **Kelvin Scale (K)**: The absolute temperature scale, where 0 K is absolute zero (the point at which all molecular motion stops).

## Conversion between Scales

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit**: **F = (9/5) × C + 32**
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius**: **C = (5/9) × (F - 32)**
- **Celsius to Kelvin**: **K = C + 273.15**
- **Kelvin to Celsius**: **C = K - 273.15**

# Types of Thermometers and Their Uses

## Mercury Thermometer

- A thermometer that uses mercury in a glass tube. As temperature increases, the mercury expands and rises in the tube.
  - **Uses**: Measuring body temperature, industrial temperature measurement.

## Bimetallic Thermometer

- A thermometer made of two metals with different expansion coefficients. The difference in expansion causes the metals to bend, indicating the temperature.
  - **Uses**: Industrial applications for measuring temperatures of machinery, ovens, and furnaces.

## Platinum Resistance Thermometer

- A thermometer that uses the resistance of platinum as the temperature changes. The resistance increases with an increase in temperature.
  - **Uses**: High-precision temperature measurements, scientific research, industrial applications.

## Pyrometer

- A non-contact thermometer used to measure high temperatures, typically in furnaces or molten metal.
  - **Uses**: Measuring high temperatures in industrial applications like steel manufacturing.

# Expansion of Solids, Liquids, and Gases

## Expansion of Solids

- **Linear Expansion**: Solids expand in length when heated.
  - **Coefficient of Linear Expansion**: The change in length per unit length per degree temperature change.
  - Formula: **ΔL = αL₀ΔT**, where:
    - **ΔL** = Change in length
    - **α** = Coefficient of linear expansion
    - **L₀** = Original length
    - **ΔT** = Temperature change

- **Surface Expansion**: The change in area of a solid when heated.
  - Formula: **ΔA = 2αA₀ΔT**, where:
    - **ΔA** = Change in area
    - **α** = Coefficient of linear expansion
    - **A₀** = Original area
    - **ΔT** = Temperature change

- **Volumetric Expansion**: The change in volume of a solid when heated.
  - Formula: **ΔV = βV₀ΔT**, where:
    - **ΔV** = Change in volume
    - **β** = Coefficient of volumetric expansion
    - **V₀** = Original volume
    - **ΔT** = Temperature change

## Expansion of Liquids

- Liquids expand in volume when heated. The expansion is directly related to the temperature change.
  - **Coefficient of Volumetric Expansion** for liquids can be calculated similarly to solids.

## Expansion of Gases

- Gases expand in volume when heated, and the expansion depends on the pressure and temperature conditions.
  - **Ideal Gas Law**: **PV = nRT**, where:
    - **P** = Pressure
    - **V** = Volume
    - **n** = Number of moles
    - **R** = Universal gas constant
    - **T** = Temperature in Kelvin

# Coefficient of Thermal Conductivity

- **Thermal Conductivity** is the ability of a material to conduct heat. It is defined as the amount of heat that passes through a unit area of a material of unit thickness when there is a unit temperature difference.
  - **Formula**: **Q = (kAΔT) / L**, where:
    - **Q** = Heat conducted
    - **k** = Coefficient of thermal conductivity
    - **A** = Area of cross-section
    - **ΔT** = Temperature difference
    - **L** = Thickness of the material

  - **Unit**: Watt per meter per degree Celsius (W/m·°C)

# Engineering Applications

- **Thermal Insulation**: Materials with low thermal conductivity are used for insulation, such as in walls, refrigerators, and thermos flasks.
- **Heat Exchangers**: Devices that transfer heat between two fluids (e.g., in radiators, air conditioning).
- **Solar Panels**: Absorb heat from the Sun and convert it to usable energy.
- **Construction**: Coefficients of expansion are important for designing bridges, roads, and railways to accommodate temperature changes without damage.
