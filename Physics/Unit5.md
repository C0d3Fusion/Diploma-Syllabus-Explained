# Elasticity

## Definition of Stress and Strain

- **Stress** is the force applied per unit area within materials, leading to deformation. It is a measure of the internal forces in a material.
  - Formula: **Stress = Force / Area**
  - Units: N/m² or Pascal (Pa)
  - Types of Stress: 
    1. **Tensile Stress**: Force applied to stretch an object.
    2. **Compressive Stress**: Force applied to compress an object.
    3. **Shear Stress**: Force applied parallel to the surface of the object.

- **Strain** is the deformation caused by the applied stress, which is the change in shape or size of the object.
  - Formula: **Strain = Change in Length / Original Length**
  - It is a dimensionless quantity.
  - Types of Strain: 
    1. **Tensile Strain**: Elongation or stretching of an object.
    2. **Compressive Strain**: Compression or shortening of an object.
    3. **Shear Strain**: Deformation due to shearing force.

## Moduli of Elasticity

- **Young's Modulus (E)**: It measures the stiffness of a material under tensile stress. It is defined as the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain.
  - Formula: **E = Stress / Strain**
  - Unit: Pascal (Pa)

- **Bulk Modulus (K)**: It measures the material’s response to uniform compression. It is the ratio of compressive stress to the resulting decrease in volume.
  - Formula: **K = - (Pressure change / Fractional volume change)**

- **Shear Modulus (G)**: It measures the material’s response to shear stress (force applied tangentially to the surface).
  - Formula: **G = Shear Stress / Shear Strain**

---

## Hooke’s Law

- **Hooke's Law** states that the strain in a solid material is directly proportional to the applied stress within the elastic limit of the material.
  - Formula: **Stress = k × Strain**, where **k** is the proportionality constant.
  - This law holds true for small deformations (elastic region).

## Significance of Stress-Strain Curve

- The **Stress-Strain Curve** shows the relationship between stress and strain for a material under load. It helps in understanding the material’s elastic behavior.
- The curve typically includes the following regions:
  - **Proportional Limit**: Where Hooke’s Law applies.
  - **Elastic Limit**: Beyond which the material will not return to its original shape.
  - **Yield Point**: The point where permanent deformation begins.
  - **Ultimate Strength**: Maximum stress the material can withstand.
  - **Fracture Point**: The point at which the material breaks.

# Pressure

## Definition and Units

- **Pressure** is defined as the force exerted per unit area.
  - Formula: **Pressure = Force / Area**
  - Units: Pascal (Pa) or N/m²

---

## Types of Pressure

- **Atmospheric Pressure**: The pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on an object.
  - Average atmospheric pressure at sea level: **1 atm = 101,325 Pa**.

- **Gauge Pressure**: The pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. It does not include atmospheric pressure in its calculation.
  - **Gauge Pressure = Absolute Pressure - Atmospheric Pressure**

- **Absolute Pressure**: The total pressure exerted by the fluid, including atmospheric pressure.
  - **Absolute Pressure = Gauge Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure**

## Fortin’s Barometer and Its Applications

- **Fortin’s Barometer** is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure.
  - It consists of a glass tube filled with mercury, inverted in a dish of mercury.
  - The height of the mercury column gives the atmospheric pressure.
  - Applications: Weather forecasting, determining altitude, scientific research.

# Surface Tension

## Concept

- **Surface Tension** is the force that causes the surface of a liquid to behave like a stretched elastic membrane. It is the result of cohesive forces between molecules in the liquid.
  - Units: N/m

## Cohesive and Adhesive Forces

- **Cohesive Forces**: The attractive forces between like molecules (e.g., water molecules attracting each other).
- **Adhesive Forces**: The attractive forces between unlike molecules (e.g., water molecules attracting to the surface of glass).

---

## Angle of Contact

- **Angle of Contact** (also called contact angle) is the angle formed between the liquid surface and the solid surface where the liquid touches the solid.
  - It depends on the cohesive and adhesive forces acting between the liquid and the solid.

---

## Ascent Formula (No Derivation)

- **Ascent Formula** (Capillary Rise): The rise of liquid in a capillary tube due to surface tension.
  - Formula: **h = (2Tcosθ) / (ρgr)**, where:
    - **T** = Surface tension
    - **θ** = Angle of contact
    - **ρ** = Density of the liquid
    - **g** = Gravitational acceleration
    - **r** = Radius of the capillary tube
    - **h** = Height of liquid rise

## Applications of Surface Tension

- **Formation of drops**: Water forms spherical droplets due to surface tension.
- **Capillary action**: Water rises in thin tubes due to surface tension.
- **Detergents**: Surface tension is reduced, making cleaning easier.
- **Insects walking on water**: Small insects can walk on water due to surface tension.

---

## Effect of Temperature and Impurity on Surface Tension

- **Temperature**: As temperature increases, surface tension decreases because the molecules gain more energy and move more, reducing the force between them.
- **Impurities**: The addition of impurities (e.g., soap) reduces the surface tension by disrupting the cohesive forces between molecules.

# Viscosity and Coefficient of Viscosity

## Viscosity

- **Viscosity** is the measure of a fluid’s resistance to flow.
  - Units: **Poise** (P), **kg/m.s**
  - It depends on the internal friction between fluid layers and is affected by temperature.

    - **η** = Viscosity of the fluid
    - **r** = Radius of the sphere
    - **v** = Velocity of the sphere

## Effect of Temperature on Viscosity

- As temperature increases, the viscosity of liquids decreases because the molecules move faster, reducing the internal friction.
- In gases, viscosity increases with temperature due to increased molecular motion.

## Application in Hydraulic Systems

- **Viscosity** plays a key role in hydraulic systems as it determines the flow rate of fluids and the efficiency of the system.

    - **v** = Velocity of fluid
    - **D** = Characteristic length (diameter of pipe)
