behavior. The ideal op-amp assumes infinite gain, input impedance, and bandwidth, while the practical op-amp has finite parameters, requiring careful design considerations. Op-amps can operate in open-loop (e.g., comparators) or closed-loop (e.g., amplifiers) configurations, with negative feedback enabling precise control. Key applications include:
Amplifiers: Inverting, non-inverting, and voltage followers for signal amplification and buffering.

Adder: Summing multiple signals for mixing or computation.

Differentiator: Detecting the rate of change of signals.

Integrator: Computing the time integral of signals.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing and analyzing analog circuits effectively.
