## ðŸ“š **Syllabus Topics**

### **[Unit 1: Trigonometry](./Mathematics/Unit1.md)**
- Topics include the concept of angles, measurement of angles in degrees, grades, and radians with their conversions, trigonometric ratios of allied angles, sum, and difference formulae, product formulae, trigonometric ratios of multiple and sub-multiple angles (2A, 3A, A/2), and the graphs of sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), and e^x.

### **[Unit 2: Differential Calculus](./Mathematics/Unit2.md)**

### **[Unit 3: Algebra](./Mathematics/Unit3.md)**
- **Complex Numbers**: Topics include the definition of complex numbers, real and imaginary parts, polar and Cartesian representation, conjugate, modulus, and amplitude, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers, De-Moivre's Theorem and its application.
  
- **Partial Fractions**: Topics include the definition of polynomial fractions (proper and improper fractions), and the method to resolve proper fractions into partial fractions with non-repeated linear factors, repeated linear factors, and irreducible non-repeated quadratic factors.

- **Permutations and Combinations**: Topics include the calculation of nPr and nCr.

- **Binomial Theorem**: Topics include the Binomial Theorem (without proof) for positive integral indices, expansion and general form, and binomial theorem for any index (expansion without proof). Also covers the first and second binomial approximations with applications to engineering problems.
